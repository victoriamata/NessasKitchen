# Nessa's Kitchen
   ## Description:
   This deployed application was built using React, Typescript, and CSS. The user can view this website using laptops, computers, Ipads, tablets, and phones. The purpose of this project was to advertise my mom's business as a caterer. The viewer can read about the business owner on the landing page, click on links to contact her and view the social media pages. On the other navigation tabs, the user can view the entire menu, and fill out a working contact form to email her.
